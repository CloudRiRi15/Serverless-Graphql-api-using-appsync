# Serverless GraphQL API Using AppSync

## What are we going to build?

We will build a GraphQL API using AWS AppSync to perform CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. 

We will build a Student Information Management System. The API will allow users to create, read, update, and delete student records. We will use DynamoDB to store our students data to achieve the functionality of the CRUD API we will use Lambda. To configure our resources we will use AWS SAM
